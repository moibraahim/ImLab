# ImLab - the scientific image processing appImLab The scientific image editor app
The project is a desktop application for image processing developed in Python. The application provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for various image processing techniques. The main features of the application include Median Filter, Unsharp Masking, High Boost Filtering, Gaussian Noise, and Sobel Edge Detection.

The GUI is developed using the Tkinter module in Python. It has two pages, the welcome page, and the main page. The welcome page displays a background image and a button that leads to the main page. The main page provides users with several image processing options. Users can select an image from their computer and apply one of the image processing techniques provided by the application.

The application supports various image processing techniques such as Median Filter, which can be used to remove noise from images, Unsharp Masking, and High Boost Filtering to enhance image details, Gaussian Noise to add noise to images, and Sobel Edge Detection to detect edges in images. These features are implemented using popular image processing libraries in Python such as OpenCV and Numpy.

The application is useful for individuals who want to process images without having to write complicated code or use complex image processing software. With the help of the GUI, users can easily apply different image processing techniques to their images and save the processed images to their computer.
